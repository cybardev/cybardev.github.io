title: Mini Homelab Self-hosting Setup
description: How I set up a homelab server on an old laptop to self-host major services
---
Over the last week I set up a homelab with all the services I mostly use, on an old netbook laptop that's weaker than a modern Raspberry Pi computer. This post is to document how I did it, why I did it, and what's in store for the setup going forward. Feel free to follow along to set up your very own homelab server.
