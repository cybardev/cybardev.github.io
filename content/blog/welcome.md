## What's this about?

Usually it's just going to be me and my thoughts. Won't be regular, but
I do want to use this as a diary of sorts so might make frequent but short posts
every now and then. I will mostly post about computers and technology since
that is my field of interest. Sometimes I might also post about science and
pop culture.

## Who are you?

An undergrad computer science student from Bangladesh who loves Linux
and all things science and tech.

## What do we have to do with all this?

You could visit the site from time to time and read up some of my posts.
Who knows, you might find somehthing of interest. I will also put
affiliate links in some tech posts. If you purchase anything from the site
following those links (not necessarily the linked product), I will receive a
small comission with no extra cost to you. It'd be a nice way to show your
kind support.

**Thanks~**
