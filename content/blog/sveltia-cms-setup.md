title: My New CMS Setup
description: How a new CMS led me to enjoy writing on my blog
---
When I was still using Hugo for my website, I had set up Netlify CMS (and then moved to Decap when they changed the name), thinking it would help me write blogs more smoothly. And sure, the process was less cumbersome than opening up my local repository, firing up a code editor, writing some markdown, and going through the Git flow. But something just didn’t stick, and I ended up doing that cumbersome process anyway instead of using the CMS. Soon after, I stopped posting altogether. Not surprising.
