title: Celebrating My First Nixversary
description: What a year of Nix, Nixpkgs, Flakes, and Home-Manager has been for me
---
I just crossed the 1 year mark since I started using Nix in some way or other, and I wanted to take a moment to reflect and appreciate what a positive experience it has been. What started off as a little curiosity has now become a lifeline — a tool that actively boosts my productivity, and allows me to focus on what’s important. It’s also been impactful in helping me understand how my system works, and cutting down unnecessary bloat.

Became the maintainer of Meta’s Pyrefly (Python type checker and LSP) package on Nixpkgs. Made PR (awaiting review) to add and maintain Huggingface’s Git-Xet package. Crafted a multi-machine, multi-platform config with shared modules. Maintaining a personal Nix package and module set for stuff I find interesting but don’t quite want to commit to maintaining in upstre Nixpkgs.
