Schrödinger's Cat  
Looks around curiously.  
Its fate uncertain but it cares not  
For it's unaware of its gravity.  

Schrödinger's Cat  
It meows and yawns  
And lays its head down.  
Lush black fur, trimmed with care.  
He slips into a slumber.  

Schrödinger's Cat  
Will he die?  
Or will he hold onto his nine lives?  
Nobody knows, until  
The observer takes a peek.  

Curiosity killed the cat, they say.  
Was he ever even that curious?  
He was trapped in a box,  
With not much else  
And nowhere to wander away.  

Schrödinger's Cat  
The observer saw  
Sleeping soundly.  
His spirit in peace  
Free from the bounds  
Of the cold hard earth  
That gifted him cruelty.  

He had a chance, they say,  
Fifty-fifty - to pass on or to survive.  
Till the lid was popped  
He was half alive.  
Or so the science said.  
It wasn't his fault, definitely not.  
Nor of the observer's eye.  

Tis but a twist of fate, just that  
Nothing to do about it.  
His spirit passed on,  
Peacefully I hope.  
All we can do is pray.  

Schrödinger's Cat  
We say goodbye.  
We bid farewell  
With tears in our eyes.  
But we forget him next day  
And go on with our lives.  
Like nothing ever happened.  
It's as if he never existed.  

It's okay. Life goes on.  
The tides of time  
Wait for none.  
I just hope that  
Schrödinger's Cat  
Is remembered sometimes  
By someone.
