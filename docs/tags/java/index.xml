I will also refer to array concepts, so you may want to read that first if you&amp;rsquo;re new to Java collections.
What are lists? Think of lists like a row of cardboard boxes. These boxes can be used to store different types of data - ints, Strings, even custom data types like Person. You can add more boxes to the row, remove boxes from the row, or even have no boxes at all!</description></item><item><title>Java Arrays Explained</title><link>https://cybarspace.github.io/blog/java-arrays/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 16:03:05 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://cybarspace.github.io/blog/java-arrays/</guid><description>What are arrays? Think of arrays like a row of cardboard boxes. These boxes can be used to store different types of data - ints, Strings, even custom data types like Person.
One important thing to note is that you can only have a constant number of these boxes for each array you make. While making the array, if you tell Java that this array will have 10 items, then that array will always be able to contain up to 10 items - no more, no less, no changes to this size.</description></item></channel></rss>
